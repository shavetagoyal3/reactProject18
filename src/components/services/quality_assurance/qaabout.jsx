          <h3>Enterprise, Mobile, and Web Testing</h3>
          <p>
            As a company that prides itself on developing high-quality
            enterprise software solutions, we take Quality Assurance seriously.
            Each project we take on goes through numerous iterations of testing
            to ensure smooth performance, user-friendliness, and bulletproof
            security.
          </p>
          <h3>Dedicated Teams</h3>
          <p>
            Ensure that Quality Assurance does not become the weakest link in
            your software development workflow. Intellectsoft can help you fill
            key positions in your production team with Quality Assurance
            specialists that have proven themselves to be exceptionally thorough
            and have had experience in testing enterprise solutions, mobile
            applications, and web applications.
          </p>
          <h3>Software Audit</h3>
          <p>
            Sometimes the only thing that’s missing is an objective outsider’s
            look at the software that is helping you run your business. Bring in
            a team of experienced Quality Assurance specialists and consultants
            to analyze your software and spot key problem areas and discover
            potential growth opportunities.

          <p>
            Each project we take on goes through several or all of the following
            testing stages:
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>
              Functionality Testing — We go through and check the software to
              ensure its front-end and back-end perform smoothly.
            </em>
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>
              Compatibility Testing — We ensure that the software will work on
              the hardware used by your employees and your customers.

          </p>
          <p>

          </p>
          <p>
            <em>

              ensure your data is safe and your security is bulletproof.

          </p>
          <p>
