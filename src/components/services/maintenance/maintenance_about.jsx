            Perfect software has never been built, and that's perfectly alright.
            User preferences vary too widely and change too rapidly for software
            to simultaneously satisfy everyone. The one thing all users do
            expect, however, is a baseline level of reliability and performance.
            That's why you'll want a clear plan of action for maintaining a
            consistent user experience â€” regardless of what technical challenges
            you face behind the scenes.
