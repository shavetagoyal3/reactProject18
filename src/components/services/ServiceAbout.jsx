                  While it is possible to build your workflow around software,
                  modeling and creating software to accommodate the needs of
                  your enterprise can achieve superior results. Intellectsoft’s

                  The demand for talented development and IT teams is higher
                  than ever but sourcing candidates individually is costly in
                  time and resources. Therefore, short and long-term dedicated
                  teams have become an imperative staffing supplement for many
                  enterprise companies and well-funded startups. Intellectsoft’s
                  staff augmentation service expedites companies through the
                  traditional staffing process and provides these sought after
                  developers from our in-house technical talent pool. Here are
                  some benefits we provide for organizations seeking to overcome
                  the shortage of talent and scale their way towards production:
